#jQuery Accordion

Use jQuery and CSS animations to display content accordion-style!

jQuery version is 3.0.0.min.

CSS transitions were added to classes linked with each ul item. This allows for each ul element to be positioned
according to whether their "open" class is toggled on or off. Note that the .section1 ul does not need to move at all.
Only the .section2 and .section3 uls need to move in order for the accordion feature to work.

main.js uses jQuery to select the corresponding ul box and reposition it when the div header is clicked by the user.
